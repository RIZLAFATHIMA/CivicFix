A citizen issue reporting platform using AI for categorization and efficient departmental routing.

CivicFix: Your City, Connected.
CivicFix is a powerful platform designed to streamline community problem-solving, making it easier for citizens to report issues and for local administrations to respond effectively. From a broken streetlight to a fallen tree, CivicFix ensures your concerns are heard and addressed.

How It Works

For Citizens:
Report Issues Easily: Submit problems with a title, description, photos, and pinpoint their location on a map.
See & Upvote: Browse local issues, sort by popularity (upvotes) and upload date, and support important causes with a single click.
Stay Updated: Receive email notifications the moment an issue you reported is resolved.

For Administration:
Intelligent Routing: Our AI-based system instantly classifies and sends new issues to the correct department (e.g., Electrical, Water).
Smart Dashboards: Department Heads see relevant issues, can update statuses (Pending, Being Done, Resolved), and focus on resolutions.
Overall Oversight: A Main Admin gets a comprehensive view of all city-wide issues, enabling data-driven decisions and performance monitoring.
