## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CivicFix
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

```

### 4. Supabase Database Setup

#### Create Tables

Run these SQL commands in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Users table (extends Supabase auth.users)
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user' CHECK (role IN ('user', 'dept_admin', 'main_admin')),
  department_id UUID REFERENCES departments(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Departments table
CREATE TABLE departments (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Issues table
CREATE TABLE issues (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  location TEXT,
  latitude DECIMAL(10, 8),
  longitude DECIMAL(11, 8),
  image_url TEXT,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'in_progress', 'resolved', 'rejected')),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) NOT NULL,
  department_id UUID REFERENCES departments(id) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Upvotes table
CREATE TABLE upvotes (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  issue_id UUID REFERENCES issues(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(issue_id, user_id)
);

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_issues_user_id ON issues(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_issues_department_id ON issues(department_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_issues_status ON issues(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_issues_created_at ON issues(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_upvotes_issue_id ON upvotes(issue_id);
```

#### Insert Sample Departments

```sql
INSERT INTO departments (name, email, description) VALUES
('Roads & Transportation', 'roads@city.gov', 'Handles road maintenance, traffic signals, and transportation issues'),
('Water & Sanitation', 'water@city.gov', 'Manages water supply, sewage, and drainage systems'),
('Electricity & Power', 'power@city.gov', 'Handles electrical infrastructure and power outages'),
('Public Safety', 'safety@city.gov', 'Manages crime, vandalism, and public safety concerns'),
('Parks & Recreation', 'parks@city.gov', 'Maintains parks, playgrounds, and recreational facilities'),
('Public Health', 'health@city.gov', 'Handles health-related issues and sanitation'),
('Education', 'education@city.gov', 'Manages school-related infrastructure issues'),
('General Maintenance', 'maintenance@city.gov', 'Handles general maintenance and miscellaneous issues');
```

#### Set up Row Level Security (RLS)

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE departments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE issues ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE upvotes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users can read their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON users
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Users can update their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON users
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Public can read departments
CREATE POLICY "Public can view departments" ON departments
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Users can read all issues
CREATE POLICY "Users can view issues" ON issues
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Users can create issues
CREATE POLICY "Users can create issues" ON issues
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can update their own issues
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own issues" ON issues
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Public can read upvotes
CREATE POLICY "Public can view upvotes" ON upvotes
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Users can create upvotes
CREATE POLICY "Users can create upvotes" ON upvotes
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### 5. Storage Setup

Create a storage bucket for issue images:

1. Go to Storage in your Supabase dashboard
2. Create a new bucket called `issue-images`
3. Set the bucket to public
4. Add this policy to allow authenticated users to upload:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload images" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'issue-images' AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

CREATE POLICY "Public can view images" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'issue-images');
```

### 6. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
